# AWS EC2

## Introduction to EC2 Service

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a core service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides scalable, on-demand computing capacity in the cloud. EC2 allows users to launch and manage virtual servers—known as "instances"—which can run a wide range of operating systems and applications.

### Key Features
- **Scalability**: Easily scale instances up or down based on demand
- **Customizable Instances**: Choose instance types based on CPU, memory, and storage needs
- **Secure Access**: Use SSH keys and security groups for secure connections
- **Flexible Pricing**: Multiple purchasing options to optimize costs

### Use Cases
- Hosting web applications
- Running batch jobs or machine learning models
- Building development and testing environments
- High-performance computing workloads

## AWS Dashboard and EC2 Overview

### AWS Management Console
The AWS Management Console is the primary interface for managing AWS resources. It is a web application that allows you to:
- Access and manage services like EC2, S3, RDS, and Lambda
- Monitor your usage and billing
- Set up security configurations and permissions

#### Key Components of the Dashboard
1. **Navigation Bar**: Displays your logged-in account, active region, and access to global services
2. **Service Search Bar**: Helps you quickly locate AWS services by name
3. **Resource Groups**: Allows grouping and managing related resources
4. **Recent Services**: List of services you used recently for quick access
5. **Build a Solution**: Quick links to common tasks

#### Best Practices
- Always verify the active region to avoid deploying resources in unintended locations
- Use the Billing Dashboard to track costs and identify unusual usage patterns

### Region vs Availability Zone (AZ)
AWS resources are deployed in Regions and Availability Zones to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and low latency.

#### Region
- A geographical location, such as **US East (N. Virginia)** or **Asia Pacific (Mumbai)**
- Each region is independent and contains multiple Availability Zones
- Choose a region based on proximity to users, compliance requirements, and cost

#### Availability Zone (AZ)
- A physically distinct data center within a region
- Each AZ is isolated but connected to other AZs in the same region via low-latency links
- Example: **Asia Pacific (Mumbai)** has three AZs: ap-south-1a, ap-south-1b, ap-south-1c

#### Why Regions and AZs Matter
- **High Availability**: Deploy resources across multiple AZs to ensure uptime during failures
- **Low Latency**: Choose regions close to your users to minimize network delays
- **Cost Optimization**: Some regions have lower costs for the same services

## Security Groups and Remote Access

### Security Groups
Security Groups act as virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for your AWS instances.

#### Key Concepts
- **Inbound Rules**: Define the traffic allowed to reach your instance
- **Outbound Rules**: Define the traffic allowed to leave your instance
- Rules specify protocol, port range, and source

#### Common Ports
- **SSH (Port 22)**: Used for secure remote access to Linux instances
- **RDP (Port 3389)**: Used for remote access to Windows instances

#### Security Group Configuration for SSH and RDP

| Type | Protocol | Port Range | Source (Recommended) | Purpose |
|------|----------|------------|-----------------------|---------|
| SSH  | TCP      | 22         | YOUR_PUBLIC_IP/32     | Linux   |
| RDP  | TCP      | 3389       | YOUR_PUBLIC_IP/32     | Windows |

#### Steps to Configure Security Groups
1. Go to "Security Groups" in the EC2 Console
2. Select your security group or create a new one
3. Under "Inbound rules," click "Edit inbound rules"
4. Add rules for SSH (port 22) and RDP (port 3389)
5. Set Source to your IP address or trusted range
6. Save the rules

## Interview Question 
#### Difference between Security Grou and NACL 

| Feature | Security Groups | Network ACLs (NACLs) |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Layer** | Instance level (Layer 4) | Subnet level (Layer 4) |
| **State** | **Stateful** - Return traffic is automatically allowed | **Stateless** - Return traffic must be explicitly allowed |
| **Rule Evaluation** | All rules are evaluated before deciding | Rules are evaluated in order (lowest to highest) |
| **Rule Actions** | Allow rules only | Allow AND Deny rules |
| **Number of Rules** | Up to 60 inbound, 60 outbound per security group | Up to 20 rules (numbered 1-32766) per NACL |
| **Scope** | Applied to instances | Applied to entire subnet |
| **Default Behavior** | **Deny all inbound**, Allow all outbound | **Deny all inbound AND outbound** |

---
#### Best Practices
- Restrict access to specific IP ranges for security
- Use custom security groups for different applications or roles
- Regularly review and update security group rules

### SSH Service: Secure Shell Basics

#### What is SSH?
SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol that provides a secure way to access remote servers and systems.

#### Key Features of SSH
- **Secure Communication**: Uses encryption to secure the connection
- **Authentication**: Supports password-based or key-based authentication
- **Port Forwarding**: Allows secure tunneling of other protocols
- **File Transfers**: Includes tools like `scp` and `rsync`

#### SSH in AWS
**Default Settings for AWS EC2:**
- **Port**: 22 (must be open in the security group)
- **Authentication**: Key-pair (`.pem` file) generated during instance creation

#### Setting Up SSH for Remote Access
1. **Install SSH Client** (usually pre-installed on Linux/Mac, use PowerShell or PuTTY on Windows)
2. **Set File Permissions**:
   ```bash
   # chmod 400 /path/to/key.pem
   Troubleshooting SSH Connection Issues
   Verify that the instance is running
   Check the public IP and ensure it matches the instance
   Ensure your IP is allowed in the security group
   Verify key file permissions
