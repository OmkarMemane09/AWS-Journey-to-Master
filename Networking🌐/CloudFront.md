# üåê Amazon CloudFront

Amazon **CloudFront** is a **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** service that speeds up the distribution of your **static and dynamic web content**, such as `.html`, `.css`, `.php`, images, and media files.

CloudFront delivers content via a **worldwide network of edge locations**, ensuring:
- **Low latency**
- **High transfer speed**
- **Improved load time**
- **Better global performance**

It works by caching copies of content closer to the end users at **Edge Locations**, reducing the load on your origin servers.

## üîê Security & Compliance

CloudFront is deeply integrated with AWS security services:

- **AWS Shield Standard**: Free DDoS protection
- **AWS WAF**: Protect apps from SQLi, XSS, etc.
- **ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)**: Free SSL/TLS certificate provisioning
- **Field-Level Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive form fields (e.g., credit card numbers)
- **Signed URLs/Cookies**: Restrict access to premium/private content
- **Geo Restriction**: Allow/deny content delivery by country

## üí° Must Know 

- ‚úÖ Use **versioned URLs** to manage content caching (`style.v1.css`, `script.v2.js`)
- ‚úÖ Configure **cache policies** properly to avoid stale or over-requested data
- ‚úÖ Use **CloudFront Functions** for lightweight header manipulation or redirects
- ‚úÖ Set up **origin failover** between primary and secondary origins
- ‚úÖ Enable **gzip/Brotli compression** for faster content delivery
- ‚úÖ Monitor using **CloudWatch metrics** and access logs
- ‚úÖ Secure your distributions with **HTTPS** and WAF rules
