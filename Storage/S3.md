# ☁️ Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
Amazon S3 to store, manage, analyze, and protect any amount of data for virtually any use case, such as data lakes, cloud-native applications, and mobile apps.


## 📖 Introduction
**Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** is an **object storage service** that offers:
- Industry-leading **scalability, durability, and security**
- Storage for **any amount of data** from **anywhere**
- Support for multiple use cases like:
  - Data lakes
  - Cloud-native applications
  - Mobile apps
  - Backup & archival

S3 stores data as **objects** inside **buckets**.

---

## 🪣 Buckets in S3
- Buckets must have a **globally unique name** (across all regions & accounts).
- Buckets are defined at a **region level**.
- S3 looks like a global service, but buckets exist in **specific regions**.

### ✅ Naming Conventions
| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🔡 Lowercase only | No uppercase letters allowed |
| ❌ No underscores | Use `-` instead |
| 🔢 Length | 3–63 characters |
| 🚫 Not IP | Cannot look like an IP address (`192.168.0.1`) |
| 🅰️ Start | Must start with a lowercase letter or number |
| 🚫 Prefix | Cannot start with `xn--` |
| 🚫 Suffix | Cannot end with `-s3alias` |

# 🌐 Deploying a Static Website on AWS S3

Amazon S3 allows you to **host a static website** (HTML, CSS, JS) directly from a bucket.  

---

## 🚀 Steps to Deploy

### **Step 1: Create a Bucket**
- Go to the **S3 service** in the AWS console.
- Click **Create Bucket**.
- ✅ Ensure:
  - Unique bucket name (e.g., `my-website-demo`).
  - **General Purpose** selected.
  - Choose a region close to users.
- Leave defaults → **Create bucket**.

---

### **Step 2: Upload Website Files**
- Open your bucket → **Upload**.
- Drag & drop **all website files** (HTML, CSS, JS, images).  
⚠️ *Do not upload the entire folder — only the files inside.*

---

### **Step 3: Enable Static Website Hosting**
- Go to **Properties** tab.
- Scroll to **Static website hosting → Edit**.
- Enable hosting:
  - **Index document** → `index.html`
  - *(Optional)* Error document → `error.html`
- Save changes.

---

### **Step 4: Configure Permissions**
1. **Block Public Access**  
   - Go to **Permissions → Block public access**.  
   - 🔓 Uncheck *Block all public access*.  
   - Confirm.

2. **Object Ownership**  
   - Set **ACLs enabled**.  
   - Choose **Bucket owner preferred**.

3. **Access Control List (ACL)**  
   - For **Everyone (public access)** → grant:  
     - ✅ Read  
     - ✅ List  

---

### **Step 5: Make Objects Public**
- Go to **Objects** tab.
- Select all files → **Actions → Make public using ACL**.
- Confirm.

---

### **Step 6: Access the Website**
- Go to **Properties → Static website hosting**.
- Copy the **Bucket website endpoint URL**:  
---
## ❓ Is S3 a global service but bucket a regional service?

### ✅ Answer: Yes  

**Reason:**  
- **S3 is a Global Service**  
  - It provides a **single global namespace** → bucket names must be unique worldwide.  
  - Accessible from any region through the same AWS console and APIs.  

- **Bucket is a Regional Resource**  
  - When creating a bucket, you must choose a **specific AWS region** (e.g., `ap-south-1`).  
  - Data inside the bucket is physically stored and replicated **only within that region’s Availability Zones**.  
  - Bucket endpoints are **region-specific** (e.g., `mybucket.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com`).  

👉 **In short:**  
S3 is global, but each bucket and its data live in a specific AWS region.

## 🪣 General Purpose vs Directory Bucket

| Feature | General Purpose Bucket | Directory Bucket |
|---------|------------------------|------------------|
| 📍 Scope | Regional (data stored in one AWS region) | Zonal (data stored in one Availability Zone) |
| 🌐 Use Case | Standard object storage for most workloads (websites, backups, apps) | Low-latency workloads that need single-AZ access |
| 🔄 Durability | Data replicated across multiple AZs in a region | Data stored in one AZ only (lower durability) |
| 💰 Cost | Slightly higher (multi-AZ replication) | Lower cost (single-AZ storage) |
| 🌟 Availability | High (multi-AZ) | Limited (single AZ — less resilient) |

## 📊 Comparison: EBS vs EFS vs S3

| **Features**        | **Amazon S3** (Object Storage) | **Amazon EBS** (Block Storage) | **Amazon EFS** (File Storage) |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Type of Storage**  | Object storage | Block storage | File storage |
| **Scalability**      | Unlimited scalability | Manual scaling (increase/decrease volume size) | Unlimited scalability |
| **Reliability**      | Redundant across multiple AZs | Stored in a single AZ | Redundant across multiple AZs |
| **Availability**     | Up to 99.99% (Standard) | Guaranteed uptime 99.99% | No formal SLA |
| **Security**         | Encryption at rest & in transit | Encryption at rest & in transit | Encryption at rest & in transit |
| **Backup & Restore** | Cross-region replication & versioning | Snapshots (automated every 15 mins) | Replication supported (EFS to EFS) |
| **Performance**      | Slower compared to EBS & EFS | Fastest (higher IOPS & throughput) | Faster than S3, slower than EBS |
| **Accessibility**    | Public & private access | Accessible only via attached EC2 | Shared access across multiple EC2 & on-premises |
| **Interface**        | Web-based interface | File system interface | Web + file system interface |
| **Pricing Model**    | Pay-as-you-go | Pay for provisioned capacity | Pay-as-you-go |
| **Use Cases**        | Big data, backups, media, archives, web hosting | Boot volumes, databases, ETL workloads | Media, analytics, backups, content management, shared home directories |
