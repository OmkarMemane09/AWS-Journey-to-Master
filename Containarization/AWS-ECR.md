# ☁️ AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) 

---

## 🧭 What is AWS ECR?

**Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)** is a **fully managed container image registry** provided by AWS.  
It allows developers to **store, manage, and deploy Docker container images** securely and efficiently.

ECR integrates directly with **Amazon ECS**, **EKS**, and **AWS Lambda**, enabling smooth CI/CD pipelines and container deployments.

## 🧱 Key Features of AWS ECR

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Fully Managed** | AWS handles scaling, availability, and maintenance. |
| **Secure** | Integrates with AWS IAM for fine-grained access control. |
| **High Availability** | Built on AWS infrastructure with redundancy and fault tolerance. |
| **Integration** | Works seamlessly with ECS, EKS, CodePipeline, and CodeBuild. |
| **Private & Public Repositories** | Allows both private and public image hosting. |
| **Lifecycle Policies** | Automatically delete unused or old images to save costs. |

## 🧩 Components of AWS ECR

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Repository** | A logical collection that stores Docker images. |
| **Registry** | The entire ECR service for your AWS account and region. |
| **Images & Tags** | Each image has a unique tag (like `v1`, `latest`) to identify versions. |
| **Permissions (IAM)** | Access controlled through AWS Identity and Access Management. |

# ⚖️ Difference Between AWS ECR and Docker Hub

| Feature | **Docker Hub** | **AWS ECR** |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| **Ownership** | Managed by **Docker Inc.** | Managed by **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** |
| **Integration** | Works with all Docker environments | Deeply integrated with **AWS services** like ECS, EKS, and CodePipeline |
| **Authentication** | Uses Docker ID or Personal Access Token | Uses **AWS IAM roles and credentials** |
| **Repository Type** | Public and Private repositories | Private (default) and Public (optional) |
| **Pricing Model** | Free tier with limited pulls, paid for team/private repos | Pay-as-you-go for **storage and data transfer** |
| **Access Control** | Basic team/organization-based access | Fine-grained access control via **IAM policies** |
| **Performance** | Global CDN by Docker | Regional, optimized for **AWS cloud performance** |
| **Security** | Standard authentication and image scanning | **IAM + KMS encryption + VPC integration** for high security |
| **Best For** | Sharing open-source or public images | Managing private enterprise-level container images |
| **Example URL Format** | `docker.io/username/image:tag` | `account-id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/repo-name:tag` |

# 💡 Use Cases

| **Scenario** | **Recommended Platform** | **Reason** |
|---------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Hosting **public images** for open-source projects | 🐳 **Docker Hub** | Global visibility and easy sharing |
| Managing **private company images** securely | ☁️ **AWS ECR** | IAM-based access control and AWS integration |
| Using in **CI/CD pipelines on AWS** | ☁️ **AWS ECR** | Works directly with ECS, EKS, and CodeBuild |
| For **local testing and quick deployments** | 🐳 **Docker Hub** | Simple setup and quick image access |
| When **multi-cloud portability** is needed | 🐳 **Docker Hub** | Works across all platforms, not tied to AWS |
| When **data security and compliance** are required | ☁️ **AWS ECR** | Enterprise-grade encryption and control |

## ⚙️ Steps to Push an Image to AWS ECR

Follow these steps to upload a local Docker image to ECR.

```bash

### **Step 1️⃣ — Configure AWS CLI**
aws configure
🔹 Enter your Access Key, Secret Key, Region (e.g., ap-south-1), and output format (json).
This connects your CLI to your AWS account.

Step 2️⃣ — Create a Repository
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-cont
🔹 Creates a new ECR repository named my-cont.

Step 3️⃣ — Authenticate Docker with ECR
aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-south-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 472173421444.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
🔹 Logs Docker into ECR using your AWS credentials.
🔹 You should see Login Succeeded.

Step 4️⃣ — Tag the Local Image
docker tag ubuntu:latest 472173421444.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/my-cont:latest
🔹 Adds a new tag pointing to your ECR repository.
🔹 ubuntu:latest → local image name.
🔹 my-cont:latest → ECR repository and version tag.

Step 5️⃣ — Push the Image to ECR
docker push 472173421444.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/my-cont:latest
🔹 Uploads image layers to your ECR repository.

Step 6️⃣ — Verify the Upload
Go to AWS Console → ECR → Repositories → my-cont → Images
✅ You’ll see your uploaded image listed.
```

## 📥 Steps to Pull an Image from AWS ECR

If you want to use this image on another EC2 instance or system:

Step 1️⃣ — Login to ECR
aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-south-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 472173421444.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com

Step 2️⃣ — Pull the Image
docker pull 472173421444.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/my-cont:latest

Step 3️⃣ — Run the Container
docker run -it 47211444.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/my-cont:latest /bin/bash
✅ Now you’re running the image directly from AWS ECR.
